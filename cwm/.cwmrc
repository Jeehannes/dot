#
# There are two directives that aren't included in the default keyboard shortcuts
# list: group-only-[n] and window-movetogroup-[n] (where [n] is the number corresponding to
# window groups 1-9).
#
# You can select a group and add a window to it. And you can toggle that group's
# visibility with CM-[n].

# But, window groups get more powerful when you can select a window group while
# hiding windows in any other group.

# To do this, I added the following to my ~/.cwmrc (and typed CMS-r):

bind-key M-1 group-only-1
bind-key M-2 group-only-2
bind-key M-3 group-only-3
bind-key M-4 group-only-4
bind-key M-5 group-only-5
bind-key M-6 group-only-6
bind-key M-7 group-only-7
bind-key M-8 group-only-8
bind-key M-9 group-only-9
bind-key MS-1 window-movetogroup-1
bind-key MS-2 window-movetogroup-2
bind-key MS-3 window-movetogroup-3
bind-key MS-4 window-movetogroup-4
bind-key MS-5 window-movetogroup-5
bind-key MS-6 window-movetogroup-6
bind-key MS-7 window-movetogroup-7
bind-key MS-8 window-movetogroup-8
bind-key MS-9 window-movetogroup-9

# Now, if I type M-2, it only shows windows in window group 2.
# And, I can more easily move windows to other groups with MS-[n].
# For instance, shift+alt+2 will move the current window to group 2
